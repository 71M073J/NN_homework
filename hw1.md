##Solve exercises 1.12 b) and d), 2.3, and 2.6.
###1.12b)
Exercise 1.12 Show that the standard measurable space on  
Ω = { 0 , 1 , . . . , ∞ }
equipped with Poisson measure is a discrete probability space.

&Sigma;<sub>k=0</sub><sup>&infin;</sup>(λ<sup>k</sup>e<sup>-&lambda;</sup>)/k! 

= e<sup>-&lambda;</sup> &Sigma;<sub>k=0</sub><sup>&infin;</sup>(λ<sup>k</sup>)/k! 

= <sub>(by Taylor series)</sub> e<sup>-&lambda;</sup>e<sup>&lambda;</sup> = 1
###1.12d)
R: Draw 1000 samples from the Poisson distribution  
λ = 10 (rpois) and compare relative frequencies with theoretical probability measure.
```
set.seed(1)
pois_samp <- rpois(n = 1000, lambda = 10)
pois_samp <- data.frame(x = pois_samp) %>%
  count(x) %>%
  mutate(n = n / 1000, type = "empirical_frequencies") %>%
  bind_rows(data.frame(x = 0:25, n = dpois(0:25, lambda = 10), type = "theoretical_measure"))

pois_plot <- ggplot(data = pois_samp, aes(x = x, y = n, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge")
plot(pois_plot)
```
###2.3)
Exercise 2.3 Let C and D be two collections of subsets on  
Ω such that C ⊂ D . Prove that σ ( C ) ⊆ σ ( D ) .

given that C is a subset of D, the sigma algebra generated by D MUST contain at least all elements of C, their complements and their unions/intersections
and aside that the same for the elements that D contains, which are not in C, as we can expand the algebra generated by C to the one generated by D.

###2.6)

Exercise 2.6 Show that the Lebesgue measure of rational numbers on  [ 0 , 1 ] is 0. 
as the lebesgue measure of countable sets is 0, as they are simply an infinite sum of singletons of which the measure is 0
, and the finite subset of rational numbers contains a countable infinity
of numbers, therefore its lebesgue measure is 0.

R: Implement a random number generator, which generates uniform samples of irrational numbers in  
[ 0 , 1 ] by uniformly sampling from [ 0 , 1 ] and rejecting a sample if it is rational.
